KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Strengths:
  ✓ Exceptional attack detection rate (99.02%)
  ✓ Very few missed attacks (only 0.98%)
  ✓ Model is lightweight (857 KB)
  ✓ Fast inference time
  ✓ Works on sequence-level data

Current Limitation:
  ⚠ High false alarm rate (98.30% of normal traffic flagged as attacks)
  
Why This Happens:
  • The model is very conservative (low threshold 0.185118)
  • This is GOOD for security-critical applications
  • Normal traffic patterns are diverse and reconstruction error varies

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE USE:
   ✓ Deploy with current threshold (0.185118)
   ✓ Use for security-critical monitoring
   ✓ Accept high false alarm rate as trade-off for safety

2. SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:
   • Retrain with different sequence lengths (20, 40, 50)
   • Adjust model architecture (more/fewer layers)
   • Try different optimizers or learning rates

3. MEDIUM-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:
   • Use ensemble of multiple models
   • Implement attention mechanisms
   • Add weighted loss to penalize false positives
   • Use transfer learning from similar datasets

4. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
   • Set up alert suppression for known patterns
   • Implement feedback loop to update false positive list
   • Create different threshold levels for different network segments
   • Monitor model performance over time
